 a browser js is used to create client side apps
 a node js is used to create server side apps

 if some browser's doenst support any feature of js then its our responsibility to fix that bug But.....
 Node JS is written in the version that it was built in 
 there is no need to change anything for different browsers

 Node does not have acces to web apis like geolocation , fetch etc....
 but node can access the file system that the brower js can'that

 after installing node check it using node --version command in cmd prompt

 node is the javascript that runs out of the browsers

 if you try to acces window in node it will crash your app bcoz there is no brower so No window

 in gloval variable concept the tutor has not introduced all the global varaiables they have shown few  and lot many variables will be introduced when they come into the action

 you can run the node js file by typing node filename.js or node filename .

// no need to export just call the add function and then simply require this file in 2-modules file and module.js file willl automatically call tha add_function

when we import a module , we import the execution also

for buit in modules there is no need to use ./
just type the name of module
./ is only used for user-defined modules

//You need not to assign a module to variable , you can directly use  or console them
//req =>incoming user request 
//res => server response


//npm - node package manager
// when we install node , we also install npm

//if you want a slider in your app then there are two ways
//1. create it from scratch by yourself or
//2. copy and paste someone else' code that they have already made it nd published for use

//that is npm
// we can use others' code easily by one command

//npm allows us to do three things
//1. use others' code
//2. post our code/solution
//3. reuse our code

//npm has no quality control anyone can post anything even the useless things too so be aware and make a decision on the basis of weekly downloads                                                                                                 
//i  or install both are fine i is a shortone
// we will focus on local dependency
